### Building weePickle

weePickle is based on [Mill](https://github.com/lihaoyi/mill), not sbt. (There is an sbt file, but it's just
for the documentation.) In order to build this, you will need to install
Mill:
```
brew install mill
```

#### IntelliJ
You can generate an IntelliJ project structure with:
```
./genIdea.sh
```

#### Compile

To build the entire system, say:
```
mill __.compile
```
In Mill, a single underscore `_` is the wildcard, and a double underscore
`__` is a recursive wildcard that drills into sub-modules. So the above
formula means "find all modules and submodules, and compile them".

#### Testing

Similarly, to run all unit tests:
```
mill __.test
```

#### Packaging

To create the JAR files:
```
mill __.jar
```

(There's also a `__.assembly` task, which I believe creates fatjars,
but I can't see why we would care in this case.)

#### When Things Silently Fail

Mill has one iffy characteristic: when something is broken in the
`build.sc` file, it will often fail silently. No errors or anything;
just nothing happens.

When this occurs, the `resolve` command tends to be a lifesaver. This
steps back and just shows what tasks *would* be run by the given
command, and it does generally show the errors.

So for example, when compile seems to be dead in the water, say:
```
mill resolve __.compile
```
and it will generally show you what's broken.
